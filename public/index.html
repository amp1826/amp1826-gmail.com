			We wish you and your families strength and good health in the

		</div>

		<div  class = "text-style">
			With Passover traditionally celebrated with family and friends
			many are anxious about the prospects of celebrating in a different
			way this year. 
			With the curtailing of traveling and social
			interactions, we wanted to let you know that we have decided to
			offer Passover Seder in a Box in NYC (see attached menu which is
			subject to availability of ingredients). Meals will be prepared in
			an A-rated commercial kitchen under strict Department of Health
			Guidelines.

			Some things to consider
		</div>

		<div>
			<ul class="list-style">
				<li class="list">Aside from one to two prep chefs and Hava herself, no one
					else is involved in the preparation and packaging
					of meals. The health department guidelines require
					already cooked foods to be handled with gloves, but
					we are now using gloves at every step.
				</li>
				<li class="list">
					The coronavirus is very sensitive to heat; meals are cooked at
					appropriately high temperatures, packed and then
					refrigerated in packages that are microwave and oven
					safe. The meal is then reheated by you.
				</li>
				<li class="list">
					One person will deliver meals. You can request no-contact
					delivery, which simply means the delivery person will leave
					your food in a safe place of your choosing and alert you when
					its ready for pickup.
				</li>

			Here is a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-how-get-food-safely/608008/">helpful article from The Atlantic</a> laying out why food
			delivery is a good option in these times.
			And a few  <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-frequently-asked-questions#5e6c89e5868da">FAQs from the FDA.gov website:</a>
		</div>
		

		

		<ul class="list-style-faq">
				<li class="list">Q: Can I get sick with COVID-19 from touching food, the
					food packaging, or food contact surfaces, if the coronavirus
					was present on it?
				</li>
				<li class="list">
					A: Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging
						being associated with transmission of COVID-19. Like other
						viruses, it is possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can
						survive on surfaces or objects. For that reason, it is critical to
						follow the 4 key steps of food safetyâ€” <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/keep-food-safe.html">clean, separate, cook,
						and chill.</a> 
				</li>

		<div class="text-style">
			Orders will be limited to ensure a small production team and
